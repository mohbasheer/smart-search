## ðŸ’¡ Basic Usage

The `smart-search` component requires a `searchProvider` (an asynchronous function to fetch results) and a `resultMapper` (a function to transform raw results into a format the dropdown understands).

### HTML

```html
<smart-search id="my-search" theme="light" exclude="@#$%^&*()!"></smart-search>
```

### TODO

- smart-filter. add date component, re-use smart-dropdown in filter and add unit testing
- exclude logic for copy and paste as well and default value
- highlight text in li when match found - date picker component as a Filter option
- dynamic drop down template via Slot
